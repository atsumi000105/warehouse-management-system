  * For the application:
    * If you submit a code-update, also submit appropriate tests
    * If you don't submit a code-update, submit appropriate tests to show what you want improved

## Pull Requests

* Ensure that you are using the latest pre-release version of Coverd
* Javascript: we use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and not [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  * In other words, you can update [package.json](package.json) and [yarn.lock](yarn.lock) but not `package-lock.json`
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Follow the whitespace/newline styles suggested in the [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) file (see: [editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org/) for information about this file).
* Run `yarn lint --fix`, `composer lint-fix`, and `composer analyze`. Fix any problems found before submitting your pull request.
  * If you have any errors in PHPStan like ` Ignored error pattern ...  was not matched in reported errors`, make sure that those are the only errors reported and rebuild the baseline file via `composer anaylze-baseline`. 

## Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
